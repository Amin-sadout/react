1- started with understanding the basics like how imports and export work here, what jsx is and how everything connects to eachother so far

2-exploring dynamic values and see what works and what throws an error (and why)

3-installed simple react snippets, i created 2 componenets and added them to app.js ( home and navbar ) i also moved everything i need to move out of app.js to home.js to make the app.js clearer

4- opened a style.css file and deleted the rest, styled it a bit + added some inline style between {{}} since you need to do it that way, i guess.

5-playing around with functions, assinging it, and firing it when needed when eeded + how to do avoid it firing automatically.
