1- started with understanding the basics like how imports and export work here, what jsx is and how everything connects to eachother so far

2-exploring dynamic values and see what works and what throws an error (and why)

3-installed simple react snippets, i created 2 componenets and added them to app.js ( home and navbar ) i also moved everything i need to move out of app.js to home.js to make the app.js clearer

4- opened a style.css file and deleted the rest, styled it a bit + added some inline style between {{}} since you need to do it that way, i guess.

5-playing around with functions, assinging it, and firing it when needed when eeded + how to do avoid it firing automatically.

6- getting into hooks and useState, forgot to add that we learned how to output a list aswell.

7- we using props now and i got to understand how we can add data from one components, stick it between {} and store it in props in another componenet for us to use it there, cool shit. added some function and played around with it a bit. spend hours looking endlessly into errors
